<p>For contributions made after 1&#160;July 2022 the work test applies to you if you are aged 67 to 75&#160;years and you want to claim personal superannuation contributions deductions. If you are aged 75 and meet the work test, you can only claim a deduction for a contribution that is made on or before the day that is 28&#160;days after the end of the month in which you turn 75.</p>

<p>Prior to 1&#160;July 2022, the work test applied as a condition on a super fund accepting contributions rather than as a condition on an individual claiming a deduction for the contribution. For contributions made after 1&#160;July 2022 the work test no longer applies to individuals up to 75&#160;years old (except if claiming a personal super contribution deduction).</p>
<p>For 2020–21 this rule applied once you turned 67&#160;years old and until you turned 75&#160;years old. For earlier financial years this rule applied once you turned 65 and until you turned 75&#160;years old.</p>
